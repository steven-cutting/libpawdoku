# Commands

`just --list` prints the live set. This page says what each recipe is for. The `Justfile`
is the only supported interface: if something is worth running twice, it belongs here
rather than in a shell history.

Nine recipes reach the network: `install-toolchain`, `install-tools`, `install-allium`,
`install-hooks`, `sync`, `lock`, `lock-upgrade`, `audit` and `check-links-online`.
`just initialize` runs the first five of them (`install-hooks` only from the primary
checkout), and is the one command a fresh clone needs the network for. Nothing inside
`just check` reaches it once `just sync` has fetched the registry index: `lock-check` and
`deny` then answer from that cache, and `lint` finds every hook environment already
prepared, because `install-hooks` prepared it. On a cold Cargo cache, `lock-check` fails
rather than fetching the index. `build`, `test`,
`audit` and `check-links-online` are outside `just check`, and so is every recipe that
writes.

## Setup

| Recipe | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `just initialize` | One explicit first run. Installs the pixi environment from `pixi.lock`, the pinned toolchain, the binaries `tools.txt` and `tools-source.txt` list and the pinned `allium` binary; fetches the Cargo dependencies; normalises formatting; and installs the hook from the primary checkout; a secondary worktree skips the hook and says so. Over the network. Never stages, commits, tags or pushes. |
| `just check-toolchain` | Refuse to go on unless `cargo` is rustup's proxy, then print the active toolchain, which must be the one `rust-toolchain.toml` pins. Gate 1. |
| `just install-toolchain` | Install the toolchain, components and targets `rust-toolchain.toml` names, through rustup. Over the network when any of them is missing. |
| `just install-tools` | Install the tools conda-forge lacks into `.tools/bin/` through the environment's cargo-binstall, in two passes. The `tools.txt` pass takes a release binary or fails, never compiling; the `tools-source.txt` pass, for a tool with no release binary, takes a signed cargo-quickinstall build if one exists and otherwise builds from crates.io source with `--locked`. Over the network. |
| `just install-allium` | Download, verify and install the pinned `allium` binary into `.tools/bin/`. Over the network; no lockfile can name a binary. |
| `just sync` | Install `Cargo.lock` and `pixi.lock` exactly as committed; never rewrites either. Run after pulling. Over the network. |
| `just lock` | Relock both: `Cargo.lock` at the versions the manifests allow, and `pixi.lock` against `pyproject.toml`. Over the network. |
| `just lock-upgrade` | `cargo update` and `pixi update`: move within the manifests' constraints. Over the network. |
| `just lock-check` | Fail if a manifest and its lockfile disagree, for both lockfiles. Offline, and writes neither; fails on a cold Cargo cache until `just sync` has run. Gate 2. |
| `just install-hooks` | Install the read-only pre-commit gate and prepare every hook environment, so that `just lint` never fetches. Over the network. Run it from the primary checkout: every worktree shares one hooks directory, and the hook runs the environment of whichever worktree installed it. |

## Develop

| Recipe | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `just build` | Build every crate with every feature. Outside `just check`. |
| `just test` | Every unit and integration test through cargo-nextest with `INSTA_UPDATE=no`: a snapshot mismatch fails without writing pending files. Then every doctest through `cargo test --doc`, because nextest cannot run doctests. Outside `just check`, where `coverage` and `test-doc` run the same tests. |
| `just test-doc` | Every doctest. Gate 10. |
| `just snapshots-review` | Open cargo-insta's interactive review of pending snapshots for a person at a terminal. |
| `just snapshots-accept` | Check both locks, then rerun every unit and integration test with every feature through cargo-insta and nextest offline, and accept all pending snapshots without prompting, deleting any `.snap` file no test refers to. Writes and deletes `.snap` files; read the diff before committing and give the reason for the change. |

## Format

| Recipe | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `just format` | rustfmt and taplo, writing. |
| `just fix` | The mutating hook set, twice, then `cargo clippy --fix`, then `just lint`. The recipe that repairs what a check reports. Not the only one that writes: `just format`, `just initialize` and the lock recipes do too, and none of them is a check. |

## Check

| Recipe | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `just lint` | The whole read-only hook gate over every file. Gate 3. |
| `just fmt-check` | rustfmt, checking. Gate 4. |
| `just toml-check` | taplo's formatting check and its lint over every TOML file. Gate 5. |
| `just clippy` | Clippy over every crate target (the library, its tests, and any examples or benches) with every feature, for the host platform, with warnings as errors. The wasm targets are compiled by `wasm-check`, not linted. Gate 6. |
| `just metrics` | rustqual against `rustqual.toml`: complexity, cohesion and coupling thresholds and the module boundaries of [Layering](../explanation/layering.md), with warnings as failures; then the probe, which requires the fixture under `tests/fixtures/metrics-violation/` to break every boundary rule. Gate 7. |
| `just features` | Every feature combination compiles, through cargo-hack's powerset. Gate 8. |
| `just wasm-check` | The core compiles for `wasm32-unknown-unknown` and for `wasm32v1-none`, which has no standard library, under every feature combination. Gate 9. |
| `just coverage` | Every nextest test under instrumentation with `INSTA_UPDATE=no`, with the floor of 90 per cent of lines enforced; a snapshot mismatch fails without writing pending files. Writes `target/llvm-cov/lcov.info`. Gate 11. |
| `just doc` | rustdoc over the workspace with warnings as errors and `--cfg docsrs`. Gate 12. |
| `just deny` | cargo-deny's licence, ban and source checks over every dependency that ships, offline once `just sync` has run. Gate 13. |
| `just audit` | cargo-deny's advisory check against the RustSec database. Over the network, so outside `just check`; CI runs it weekly in its own workflow. |
| `just deps-unused` | cargo-shear: a dependency a crate declares and never uses. Gate 14. |
| `just snapshots-check` | Check both locks, then run every unit and integration test with every feature through cargo-insta and nextest offline. Fails mismatches without writing snapshots or pending files, and rejects unreferenced `.snap` files. Gate 19. |

## Documents

| Recipe | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `just check-docs` | markdownlint, `typos`, offline link check, then the documentation contract. |
| `just check-agents` | The agent contract: inventory, adapters, and skill bridges. |
| `just check-specs` | `allium check` over `docs/specs/`. Asserts that every module reports an empty `diagnostics` array; anything reported is a regression. Waiver terms: [Work with the specifications](../how-to/work-with-the-specs.md). |
| `just analyse-specs` | `allium analyse` over `docs/specs/`: the same structural diagnostics plus data flow, reachability, deadlocks and conflicts. Asserts that both arrays are empty; a finding cannot be waived, so any finding is a regression. |
| `just plan-spec <module>` | Print the raw JSON test obligations for `docs/specs/<module>.allium`; give the module name without the extension. Plans that module alone, reading no imports, so plan imported modules separately. A suggestion list: asserts nothing, writes nothing and is outside `just check`. Needs the pinned binary from `just install-allium`. |
| `just check-links-online` | Follow external links. Manual; needs the network. |

The two spec gate recipes go through `bg-run-allium`, which reads the JSON rather than
trusting the exit code — `allium check` exits 0 on an `info` diagnostic and `allium
analyse` ignores diagnostics altogether. Both need the pinned binary, so a worktree that
has not run `just initialize` must run `just install-allium` first.

## Aggregate

| Recipe | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `just check` | All twenty gates in order, proving the worktree is unchanged between each. |
| `just check-clean` | Assert the worktree is clean, or matches a supplied baseline. Gate 20. |
