# Decision 0005: A project-managed Allium binary

*Carried from Pawdoku's decision 0007 at `78d03cdf`, and restated for the library the game's engine moved to. Pawdoku's own record stands where it is. The objection to `cargo install` lapses in a Rust repository; the checksum pin does not.*

## Context

The specifications under `docs/specs/` decide every behaviour in this project, so something
has to confirm mechanically that they parse and analyse cleanly, rather than leaving
modules that outrank the code to be read by eye. `allium` is the tool that checks them.

`allium` is a Rust binary published by [`juxt/allium-tools`][upstream]. Neither
`Cargo.lock` nor `pixi.lock` can name it, which is the whole difficulty: every other pin
in this repository is proved by `just lock-check`.

Two packages share the name and are not this tool. On PyPI, `allium-cli` is a client for
the Allium *blockchain data* APIs. On npm, `allium` is a Gherkin parser. Neither has any
relationship to the specification language, and adding either would be a supply-chain
mistake wearing the right name. On crates.io a third stranger, `allium`, is an
onion-routing library; the crate that is this tool is `allium-cli`.

## Decision

Install the prebuilt release binary, pinned by version and by SHA-256, into a gitignored
`.tools/bin/`. The `biscuit-games-tooling` package that `pyproject.toml` pins holds the
version, the release URL and the checksum of each supported artefact, and
`just install-allium` runs its `bg-install-allium`. `just check-specs` and
`just analyse-specs` run the result.

The pin sits in the installer beside the URL it pins, which is the shape
`.pre-commit-config.yaml` already uses for `lychee`: the version travels with the thing it
describes rather than in a manifest with no second reader. Moving it is therefore a release
of that package, taken here by moving one line in `pyproject.toml`; the package's README
carries the checksums and how to recompute them.

`allium-cli` 3.6.1, "CLI for checking Allium specification files", is on crates.io beside
`allium-parser` 3.6.1 (verified 2026-09-25 with `cargo info allium-cli`). So
`cargo install allium-cli --locked` is a real alternative, and so is a line in `tools.txt`,
which would hand the install to cargo-binstall, or a pixi dependency should conda-forge
ever package the tool. Pawdoku rejected `cargo install` because it dragged a third
toolchain into a frontend repository; cargo is this repository's toolchain, so that
objection lapses. Neither alternative is taken. A source build costs minutes on every cold
runner and verifies nothing about what it built. A binstall of the release artefact
verifies only the checksums upstream publishes, and for the platform binaries upstream
publishes none, so binstall would trust the download it guessed the name of. The house
installer, with its four recorded values, is still the only path that proves what was
downloaded. It also keeps one owner per pin: the tooling package holds the version, moved
by one line and shared with every house repository, and the JSON-reading runner travels
with the version it was verified against.

## Consequences

The binary is not in either lockfile, so `just lock-check` cannot speak for it. This is the
same shape as cargo-hack, which `tools.txt` names and `just install-tools` puts beside it
in `.tools/bin`: a versioned artefact that `just initialize` installs and a documented
procedure keeps current. The procedure is in
[Maintain dependencies](../how-to/maintain-dependencies.md).

Checksums have to be produced by hand, because upstream publishes none that cover these
files. The release's own `SHA256SUMS.txt` lists only the editor extension and the language
server, and the Homebrew formula fills in two of the four unix targets and leaves the
`x86_64` entries as empty strings — `x86_64` Linux being exactly what continuous
integration runs on. The four recorded values were computed by downloading each artefact;
the two Homebrew does publish match. Moving the version means recomputing all four.

`.tools/` must stay ignored by Git. `just check` snapshots the worktree between recipes, so
a binary Git could see would abort the run before any recipe's exit code was read.

Both recipes are gates: hooks in `.pre-commit-config.yaml` triggered by `docs/specs/`
and by the pin itself, steps in the `documents` CI job, and gates 17 and 18 of
`just check`.

Gating took more than a line in the `Justfile`, because no exit code here carries the
verdict. `allium check` exits non-zero on warnings as well as errors but 0 on an `info`
diagnostic, and `allium analyse` keys its status on findings alone and ignores diagnostics
entirely, so a module that fails to parse passes it with the `error` in the JSON it has
just printed. Neither status means clean, so `bg-run-allium` runs the subcommand,
prints its output whole, and asserts what the contract says: an empty `diagnostics` array
and an empty `findings` array in every module. A diagnostic can be waived with a
whole-line `-- allium-ignore <code>` comment — the waiver terms are in
[Work with the specifications](../how-to/work-with-the-specs.md) — and a finding cannot.

The binary is a per-worktree install in a gitignored directory, so a worktree that has not
run `just initialize` fails `just lint` and `just check` until `just install-allium` puts
one there. That is accepted rather than softened: a gate that skips itself when its tool
is missing asserts nothing.

Only the four unix targets are supported. The release also carries a Windows zip; a target
nobody here runs would be a checksum nobody re-verifies.

## What would reopen this

Upstream publishing checksums that cover the platform binaries, which would remove the
hand computation and make a binstall prove as much as the installer does. On that day a
`tools.txt` line, or a pixi dependency if conda-forge packages the tool, replaces the
installer and this record is superseded. A distribution channel that a lockfile can name
would do the same, and would also let `just sync` install the checker, and so remove the
one cost gating it imposed.
