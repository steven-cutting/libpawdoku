# Decision 0009: The Rust quality gate

## Context

`just check` runs eighteen gates in order with the worktree snapshotted between them.
Gates 4 to 14 are Rust's: `fmt-check`, `toml-check`, `clippy`, `metrics`, `features`,
`wasm-check`, `test-doc`, `coverage`, `doc`, `deny` and `deps-unused`. The rest are the
house's: the toolchain, the lockfiles, the hooks, the documentation and agent contracts,
the specifications. This record says how ten of the eleven were chosen and where they
depart from the games' rules; the eleventh, `metrics` at gate 7, came later, when
[decision 0013](0013-metrics-gate.md) reopened the list for it, and that is its record.

Two facts shape them. The toolchain is pinned to an exact stable release in
`rust-toolchain.toml`, so the clippy lint set is stable between deliberate bumps and
`-D warnings` cannot break with no diff. And nextest, which runs the tests, cannot run
doctests, while llvm-cov cannot measure them on stable, so doctests are a gate of their
own and sit outside the coverage figure.

## Decision

Clippy's `pedantic` and `cargo` groups, and a named set beyond them, at `warn` in the
`[workspace.lints]` table of the workspace `Cargo.toml`, and `-D warnings` on the `clippy`
recipe alone: a local build never breaks mid-edit, and the gate still fails. A lint is
silenced with `#[expect(lint, reason = "...")]` on the item it names, never a blanket
`allow`, so a suppression that stops being needed reports itself; `allow_attributes` and
`allow_attributes_without_reason` enforce that. A line-coverage floor of 90 over
`crates/pawdoku/src/**`, measured by `cargo llvm-cov nextest` and enforced by
`--fail-under-lines`, lowered by lowering complexity and never by lowering the number.
`cargo hack --feature-powerset` on the host and on both wasm targets. rustdoc with
`-D warnings --cfg docsrs`, so a broken intra-doc link fails the gate. taplo for every
TOML file, formatting and lint. `cargo-shear` for a dependency nothing uses. nextest for
unit and integration tests and `cargo test --doc` for doctests, which run uncovered.
Every tool pinned in `pyproject.toml` and installed by pixi into the environment,
cargo-hack through `tools.txt`, one owner per pin (decision 0011). Clippy runs at gate 6
and in CI but never as a commit hook, because a cold run blocks every commit for tens of
seconds to minutes; the games make the same call by keeping `svelte-check` out of their
hook.

Tests are placed differently from the games, and this is a stated deviation. The games'
`AGENTS.md` says tests live in `tests/`, never colocated with `src/`. Here unit tests live
in `#[cfg(test)] mod tests` inside the module they test, integration tests in
`crates/pawdoku/tests/`, and doc examples are tests. Rust's privacy model is the reason: a
private item can only be tested from its own module, and `tests/` sees only the public
API, so a rule that kept every test out of `src/` would leave every private function
tested only through whatever public path happens to reach it. Clippy's
`tests_outside_test_module` lint holds the module shape, so a test function outside a
`mod tests` is a gate failure.

## Consequences

The ones that hurt. Pedantic lints produce false positives, and each needs an `expect`
with a reason rather than a shrug. The lint set moves with the toolchain pin, so every
bump is a clippy pass before anything else. The feature powerset doubles with each
feature added, on three targets. The floor is a statement about unit and integration
tests only; a crate whose behaviour is best shown in doc examples earns no coverage for
them. And a cold `just check` is minutes, because clippy, the powerset, coverage and
rustdoc each build.

## What would reopen this

llvm-cov measuring doctests on stable, which would fold them into the floor. Clippy's cold
time falling enough to run as a hook. A mutation-testing or fuzzing gate, which the
benchmarks spike may add and which changes what "tested" means, so the floor would be
restated rather than raised.
